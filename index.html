										<h2>My Mission</h2>
										<p>I guide business and IT leaders to champion their AI transformation, translating complex technology into strategic roadmaps that accelerate innovation and drive measurable growth.</p>
									</header>
									<p>In my current role as System Operations Director at Dallas Baptist University, I serve as the lead trusted advisor for the university's cloud strategy, guiding senior leadership on how to best leverage technology. A key accomplishment was building and championing the business case for our cloud modernization, which led to a 300% increase in Azure consumption while significantly reducing our Total Cost of Ownership. I am currently leading our Generative AI adoption strategy, evaluating platforms like Azure OpenAI to enhance both student learning and operational efficiency.</p>
									<p>This experience as an internal advisor builds on my earlier background in pre-sales and service delivery. As a Pre-Sales Project Engineer, I partnered directly with account executives to qualify customer needs, influence purchasing decisions, and support pipeline growth for small and medium business clients. My career has been about being the strategic liaison between business needs and technical solutions, and I am passionate about helping organizations achieve their most critical goals with Microsoft's Cloud and AI platforms.</p>

									<h3>My Approach</h3>
									<span class="image fit"><img src="images/approach.png" alt="" /></span>
									<p>My approach is a comprehensive journey designed to translate business needs into tangible, evolving value. Itâ€™s a process built on three core pillars: translating the vision, orchestrating the execution, and catalyzing future growth.</p>
									<p>First, I act as the <strong>Business Translator</strong>. This is where my business knowledge merges with my technical expertise. It all starts with listening intently to understand a client's core challenges and strategic goals. From there, I work to inspire a new vision and co-design a solution, building the business case and technical roadmap that serves as the blueprint for transformation.</p>
									<p>Once the vision is clear, I become the <strong>Strategic Orchestrator</strong>. This is where I take full responsibility for delivering on our promises. Drawing on my project management background, I empower the team, manage resources, and ensure every milestone is met, helping the client realize value at each step. My focus is on flawless execution to build trust and ensure the final solution achieves its intended business impact.</p>
									<p>Finally, a successful project is just the beginning. As the <strong>Growth Catalyst</strong>, I focus on the future. I help secure long-term stakeholder engagement by proving the initial project's success and identifying the next steps for a continued partnership. I believe in a cycle of continuous improvement, managing and optimizing what we've built to ensure we're always ready to launch the next initiative that will drive even greater value.</p>

									<h3>Proof of Value</h3>
									<p>Here are a few examples of how I've put my approach into action, delivering tangible results and driving transformation.</p>

												<h4>University-Wide Cloud Modernization</h4>
												<p><strong>Situation:</strong> At Dallas Baptist University, we faced aging on-premise infrastructure that was costly and couldn't scale to meet our future needs. Leadership was interested in the cloud but needed a clear business case to justify the investment.</p>
												<p><strong>Task:</strong> My role was to translate the technical benefits of Azure into a strategic and financial plan, aligning our approach with the Microsoft Cloud Adoption Framework to ensure a well-governed and successful migration.</p>
												<p><strong>Action:</strong> I led discovery workshops across departments to map our application portfolio. I then built a comprehensive business case with detailed TCO/ROI analysis and a multi-year roadmap, which I presented to senior leadership.</p>
												<p><strong>Result:</strong> The plan was approved, leading to a 300% increase in Azure consumption and a simultaneous reduction in our Total Cost of Ownership. We successfully modernized our core infrastructure, increasing agility and security across the university.</p>

												<h4>Identity and Access Management - Modernization</h4>
												<p><strong>Situation:</strong> The process for creating and managing user accounts was manual, relying on a series of disconnected scripts. This was inefficient, prone to error, and created security risks.</p>
												<p><strong>Task:</strong> My objective was to orchestrate the development and delivery of a modern, automated solution that would streamline the entire user account lifecycle.</p>
												<p><strong>Action:</strong> As the project leader, I orchestrated a team to design and build a new system using modern web applications in Azure with Python and FastAPI. I managed the project from conception to deployment, ensuring we removed roadblocks and delivered a secure, reliable solution.</p>
												<p><strong>Result:</strong> We successfully replaced the legacy scripts with a robust, cloud-native application. This dramatically improved operational efficiency, reduced manual errors, and enhanced our security posture by standardizing the account management process.</p>

												<h4>Driving the Adoption of Generative AI</h4>
												<p><strong>Situation:</strong> With the rapid advancements in Generative AI, the university's leadership recognized a critical opportunity to enhance both student learning and administrative efficiency.</p>
												<p><strong>Task:</strong> My goal is to act as a catalyst for growth by developing a strategic vision for AI adoption, aligning our initiatives with the Microsoft AI Adoption Framework to ensure we invest in the right areas for maximum impact.</p>
												<p><strong>Action:</strong> I am guiding the strategy by evaluating platforms like Azure OpenAI and identifying high-value use cases across the university. I am building the business cases needed to secure stakeholder buy-in and champion these new initiatives.</p>
												<p><strong>Result:</strong> This forward-looking strategy positions the university to be a leader in educational technology. We are creating a roadmap to unlock new levels of innovation and efficiency, ensuring we are prepared for the next wave of technological transformation.</p>

									<h3>Why This Role, Why Now?</h3>
									<p>Throughout my career, I've had the privilege of acting as an internal trusted advisor, dedicating myself to the success of a single organization. That experience taught me that the most rewarding work comes from deeply understanding a stakeholder's challenges and building the right solutions to help them thrive. I've reached a point where I want to dedicate the next chapter of my career to doing exactly that, but with a direct and dedicated focus on the customer.</p>
									<p>The Digital Solution Area Specialist role represents the perfect evolution for me because it is fundamentally customer-centric. It's an opportunity to take the skills I've honedâ€”translating complex technology, orchestrating projects, and catalyzing growthâ€”and apply them externally to help a diverse range of businesses succeed.</p>
									<p>My passion has shifted from managing internal systems to empowering external partners. I want to be in the room where I can advocate for the customer, help them navigate their AI transformation, and see them achieve their goals. This role isn't just a job; it's the ideal platform for me to fully embrace a customer-centric career and make a broader impact.</p>
